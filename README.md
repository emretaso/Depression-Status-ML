## Depression Status

Depression is a severe illness which can lead to suicide. More than 264 million people worldwide suffer from depression. It is one of the main causes for disability and the second leading cause of death in the age group of 15-29-year-olds. Fortunately, there are effective psychological and pharmacological treatments. Measuring motor activity could be one way to provide an diagnostic early warning system.

The data sets provide the motor activity of 23 patients with depression and 32 controls (healthy). The severity of the depression is assessed by experts using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). MADRS levels range from 0 to 60. Values above 30 represent a severe depression, values below 10 indicate a healthy state.
